= ConTeXt interface description

This repository is all about the ConTeXt interface (cont-en.xml and alike). Currently
you will only find the RelaxNG grammar for the interface description here.


To convert the interface.rnc to a file that xmllint can handle you can use
the trang converter:

   java -jar trang.jar -I rnc -O rnc interface.rnc interface.rng
